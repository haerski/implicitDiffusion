# Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model

Implementation of DDIM by [Song, Meng and Ermon (2020)(https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502).

A rundown of the method can be found in `notebook.ipynb`. Images don't show up on github, but will work when the repository is cloned.

The scripts `*_train.py` are used to train model weights, and the corresponding `*_sample.py` show sampling examples.
